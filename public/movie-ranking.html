<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime.I love its storyline.It shows how an intelligent high school student goes on a secret crusade to eliminate criminals from the world after discovering a notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written into it.

<p>Really cool sci-fci movie.It depicts how Earth is no longer inhabitable and humans are in search of a new planet habitable for humans.</p>
<h3>Drishyam</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film loaded with drama, crime and mystery.It shows how desperate measures are taken by a man who tries to save his family from the dark side of the law, after they commit an unexpected crime.</p>
